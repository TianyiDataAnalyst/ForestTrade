Manually closed short positions caused a big lose, due to implement new risk control module.

Also, there are about 10 counter risk positions which are cancelled. I have sent email to the broker asking the
reason.

The risk control module is updated to execute in a more sensitive scale.

A bunch of long positions are closed out trigged by stop lose. Because yesterday the counter positions are
closed or failed to open, no position could cover the unfavourable move, the balance drop to 1961.33.

Today, I will look into a Machine Learning solution that could enhance the risk control module. Looking
for the broker could answer the position cancel reason.

Yesterday, I updated the risk control module. Fixed the scanning each trade loop logic

Swing back to Arbitrage trading strategy. Develop profit pruning report. Add system One to profit taking process. Protentially, it can be implemented to system Two.
By setting number_openTrade >40 and taking profit threshold, close out unbalanced positions.

Lessons Learned:
Risk management --  account balance is not the source of risk mitigation, margin hedging is.   Buy and sell in a same range will even the risk of open positions.
So stop_loss set up to 900000 distance, in other words, disabled stop loss.
