<p>I made a trade strategy and had a backtest on this strategy. There are two datasets: Dataset One is that trade 200 units each time and only take $1 as profit;  Dataset Two is 2000 units per trade and taking $5 profit. I would like to generate some insights from the test results. For example, the risk of margin close-- my balance drops 50%, how much money I should deposit to avoid margin close. How much money I need to make sure I have enough fund to execute trade when there is no margin close.<p>This is the home page of the competition. You don't need a subtitle here.

<h2>This is a subtitle</h2>
<p>To format pages, stick to the following conventions:</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;Paragraphs should go in p tags&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;pre&gt;Code should go in pre tags&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;h2&gt;Subtitles should go in h2 tags&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
<p>You can display equations using LaTeX enclosed in escaped brackets. For example, this:</p>
<p>\[ \epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i+1))^2 } \]</p>
<p>is created by this:</p>
<pre>\[
\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i+1))^2 }
